Huge universe of Events falls under different categories. Large technology firms may hold events, which are essentially seminars, and workshops that popularize or spread awareness on their products. An automobile company may hold an event to launch a new model of a car. A soft drink company may hold a series of events across many cities to get attention on their specific brand of soft drink and so on.
Currently, there is no formal system by which orders are generated to service providers or for recording when such services were delivered and if the services were of  the right quality. So information is passed around verbally and this has caused considerable problems. Events often relied on the memory capacity of the Coordinators to remember every bit of what needs to be done, based on notes made on diaries and notes. Moreover, if services for an event were provided from a different city or if the event itself was conducted in multiple cities, it was extremely difficult to coordinate   various activities and telephone calls were the only means of sharing information so to overcome all the fallacies Ongoing.com is has potentiality  in brand-awareness building.
